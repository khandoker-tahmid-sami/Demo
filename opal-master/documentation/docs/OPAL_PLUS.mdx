:::note
OPAL is and will always be an open-source project free for all.
OPAL+ is a way for enterprise users to get more out of OPAL when needed; and is a product of OPAL users approaching us and asking for additional capabilities on top of those provided by OPAL.

If you just need a hosted version of OPAL; or you're building application-level permissions consider simply using [Permit.io's PRO tier](https://www.permit.io/pricing).
