# Running the OPAL Docker Containers

### <a name="running-docker"></a> Running docker containers

Since running OPAL is simply spinning docker containers, OPAL is cloud-ready and can fit in many environments: AWS (ECS, EKS, etc), Google Cloud, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.

Each environment has different instructions on how to run container-based applications, and as such, environment-specific instructions are outside the scope of this tutorial. We will show you how to run the container locally with `docker run`, and you can then apply the necessary changes to your runtime environment.

#### Example production setup

We at [Permit.io](https://permit.io) currently run our OPAL production cluster using the following services:

- AWS ECS Fargate - for container runtime.
- AWS Secrets Manager - to store sensitive OPAL config vars.
- AWS Certificate Manager - for HTTPS certificates.
- AWS ELB - for load balancer.

#### <a name="example-docker-run"></a> Example docker run command

Example docker run command (no worries, we will show real commands later):

```
docker run -it \
  -v ~/.ssh:/root/ssh \
  -e "OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY)" \
  -e "OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY)" \
  -e "OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=$(OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL)" \
  -p 7002:7002 \
  permitio/opal-server
```
