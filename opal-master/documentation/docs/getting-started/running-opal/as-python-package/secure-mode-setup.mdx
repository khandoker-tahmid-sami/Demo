# Running the Server and Client in Secure Mode

## Server Secure Mode

OPAL-server can run in secure mode, signing and verifying [Json Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) for the connecting OPAL-clients.
To achieve this we need to provide the server with a private and public key pair.
In addition we need to provide the server with a master-token (random secret) that the CLI (or other tools) could use to connect to ask it and generate the aforementioned signed-JWTs.

- Generating encryption keys

  - Using a utility like [ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen) we can easily generate the keys (on Windows try [SSH-keys Windows guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/generate-ssh-key-windows-10))
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem
    ```
    follow the instructions to save the keys to two files.
  - If you created the keys with a passphrase, you can supply the passphrase to the server via the `OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` option
  - You can provide the keys to OPAL-server via the `OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` and `OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY` options
  - in these vars You can either provide the path to the keys, or the actual strings of the key's content (with newlines replaced with "\_")

- Master-secret

  - You can choose any secret you'd like, but to make life easier OPAL's CLI include the generate-secret command, which you can use to generate cryptographically strong secrets easily.
    ```sh
    opal-server generate-secret
    ```
  - provide the master-token via `OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN`

- run the server with both keys and and master-secret

  ```sh
  # Run server
  # in secure mode -verifying client JWTs (Replace secrets with actual secrets ;-) )
  # (Just to be clear `~` is the user's homedir)
  export OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=~/opal
  export OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=~/opal.pub
  export OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN="RANDOM-SECRET-STRING"
  opal-server run
  ```

- Once the server is running we can obtain a JWT identifying our client
  - We can either obtain a JWT with the CLI
    ```sh
    opal-client obtain-token $OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN --server-url=$YOUR_SERVERS_ADDRESS
    ```
  - <a name="obtain-token-api"></a>Or we can obtain the JWT directly from the deployed
    OPAL server via its REST API:

```
curl --request POST 'https://opal.yourdomain.com/token' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer MY_MASTER_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "client",
}'
```

This code example assumes your opal server is at https://opal.yourdomain.com and that your master token is `MY_MASTER_TOKEN`. The `/token` API endpoint can receive more parameters, as [documented here](https://opal.permit.io/redoc#operation/generate_new_access_token_token_post).

## Client Secure Mode

- Using the master-token you assigned to the server obtain a client JWT
  ```sh
  opal-client obtain-token $OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN --server-url=$YOUR_SERVERS_ADDRESS
  ```
  You can also use the REST API to obtain the token.
- run the client with env-var `OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN` or cmd-option `--client-token` to pass the JWT obtained from the server

  ```sh
  export OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN="JWT-TOKEN-VALUE`
  opal-client run
  ```
