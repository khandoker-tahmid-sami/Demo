# Running the OPAL Server and Client in Production

## Production run Server

When running the server in production, we should set the server to work with a production server ([GUNICORN](https://gunicorn.org/))
and a backbone pub/sub.

### Gunicorn

Simply use the `run` command with the `--engine-type gunicorn` option.

  ```sh
  opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
  ```

  - (run `opal-server run --help` to see more info on the `run` command)
  - use `--server-worker-count` to control the amount of workers (default is set to cpu-count)
  - You can of course put another server or proxy (e.g. NGNIX, ENVOY) in front of the OPAL-SERVER, instead of or in addition to Gunicorn

### Backbone Pub/Sub

  - While OPAL-servers provide a lightweight websocket pub/sub channel for the clients; in order for all OPAL-servers (workers of same server, and of course servers on other nodes) to be synced (And in turn their clients to be synced) they need to connect through a shared channel - which we refer to as the backbone pub/sub or broadcast channel.
  - Backbone Pub/Sub options: Kafka, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, Redis
  - Use the `broadcast-uri` option (or `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` env-var) to configure an OPAL-server to work with a backbone.
  - for example `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run`

### Put it all together:

  ```sh
  OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
  ```

  ### Production run Client

Unlike the server, the opal-client currently supports working only with a single worker process (so there's no need to run it with Gunicorn).
This will change in future releases.
