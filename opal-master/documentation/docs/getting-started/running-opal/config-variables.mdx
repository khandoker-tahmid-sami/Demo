# Configuring Variables

### <a name="configuration"></a> Configuration Variables

We will now explain how to pass configuration variables to OPAL.

- In its dockerized form, OPAL server and client containers pick up their configuration variables from **environment variables** prefixed with `OPAL_` (e.g: `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES`, `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL`, etc).
- The OPAL CLI can pick up config vars from either **environment variables** prefixed with `OPAL_` or from **CLI arguments** (interchangeable).
  - Supported CLI options are listed in `--help`.
  - Each cli argument can match to a **corresponding** environment variable:
    - Simply convert the cli argument name to [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Multiple-word_identifiers>), and prefix it with `OPAL_`.
    - Examples:
      - `--server-url` becomes `OPAL_SERVER_URL`
      - `--data-config-sources` becomes `OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES`

### <a name="security-considerations"></a> Security Considerations (for production environments)

Soon the OPAL Security Model will be available, we have listed the mandatory checklist below:

- OPAL server should **always** be protected with a TLS/SSL certificate (i.e: HTTPS).
- OPAL server should **always** run in secure mode - meaning JWT token verification should be active.
- OPAL server should be configured with a **master token**.
- Sensitive configuration variables (i.e: environment variables with sensitive values) should **always** be stored in a dedicated **Secret Store**
  - Example secret stores: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.
  - **NEVER EVER EVER** store secrets as part of your source code (e.g: in your git repository).
