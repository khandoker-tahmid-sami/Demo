# Download the Client Image

### Step 1: Get the client image from docker hub

#### Running with inline OPA (default / recommended)

Run this command to get the image that comes with built-in OPA (recommended if you don't already have OPA installed in your environment):

```
docker pull permitio/opal-client
```

If you run in a cloud environment (e.g: AWS ECS), specify `permitio/opal-client` in your task definition or equivalent.

#### Running with standalone OPA

Otherwise, if you are already running OPA in your environment, run this command to get the standalone client image instead:

```
docker pull permitio/opal-client-standalone
```
