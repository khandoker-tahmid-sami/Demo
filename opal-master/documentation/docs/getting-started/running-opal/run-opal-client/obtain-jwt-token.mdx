# Obtain the JWT token

### Step 2: Obtain client JWT token (Optional)

In production environments, OPAL server **should** be running in **secure mode**, and the OPAL client must have a valid identity token (which is a signed JWT) in order to successfully connect to the server.

Obtaining a token is easy. You'll need the OPAL server's **master token** in order to request a JWT token.

Let's install the `opal-client` cli to a new python virtualenv (assuming you didn't [already create one](#generate-secret)):

```sh
# this command is not necessary if you already created this virtualenv
pyenv virtualenv opal
# this command is not necessary if the virtualenv is already active
pyenv activate opal
# this command installs the client cli
pip install opal-client
```

You can obtain a client token with this cli command:

```
opal-client obtain-token MY_MASTER_TOKEN --server-url=https://opal.yourdomain.com --type client
```

If you don't want to use the cli, you can obtain the JWT directly from the deployed OPAL server via its REST API:

```
curl --request POST 'https://opal.yourdomain.com/token' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer MY_MASTER_TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "client",
}'
```

The `/token` API endpoint can receive more parameters, as [documented here](https://opal.permit.io/redoc#operation/generate_new_access_token_token_post).

This example assumes that:

- You deployed OPAL server to `https://opal.yourdomain.com`
- The master token of your deployment is `MY_MASTER_TOKEN`.
  - However, if you followed our tutorial for the server, you probably generated one [here](#generate-secret) and that is the master token you should use.

example output:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJ0...8wsk",
    "type": "bearer",
    "details": { ... }
}
```

Put the generated token value (the one inside the `token` key) into this environment variable:

| Env Var Name      | Function                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN | The client identity token (JWT) used for identification against OPAL server. |

Example:

```sh
export OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN=eyJ0...8wsk
```
