# Run the OPAL Client

### Step 7: Running the client

Let's recap the previous steps with example values:

#### 1) Get the client image

First, download opal client docker image:

```sh
docker pull permitio/opal-client
```

#### 2) Set configuration

Then, declare configuration with environment variables:

```sh
# let's say this is the (shortened) token we obtained from opal server
export OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN=eyJ0...8wsk
# and this is where we deployed opal server
export OPAL_SERVER_URL=https://opal.yourdomain.com
# and let's say we subscribe to a specific tenant's data updates (i.e: `tenant1`)
export OPAL_DATA_TOPICS=policy_data/tenant1
```

and let's assume we run opa inline with the default options.

#### 3) Run the container (local run example)

```
docker run -it \
  --env OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN \
  --env OPAL_SERVER_URL \
  --env OPAL_DATA_TOPICS \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  permitio/opal-client
```

Please notice opal client exposes two ports when running opa inline:

- OPAL Client (port `:7766`) - the OPAL client API (i.e: healthcheck, etc).
- OPA (port `:8181`) - the port of the OPA agent (OPA is running in server mode).

#### 4) Run the container in production

## <a name="push-updates"></a> How to push data updates from an authoritative source

Now that OPAL is live, we can use OPAL server to push updates to OPAL clients in real time.

[We have a separate tutorial on how to trigger updates](/tutorials/trigger_data_updates).
