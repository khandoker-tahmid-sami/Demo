# Policy Repository Syncing

### Step 4: Server config - policy repo syncing (change detection)

<!-- Move this to git repos document
* OPAL server feeds the policy code (`.rego` files) and static data files (`data.json` files) it detects in the policy repo to OPA as policy bundles (OPAL bundles are not the same as OPA bundles - but they are very similar).
* If new commits are pushed to the tracked git repository **that affect rego or data files**, the updated policy will be pushed to OPA automatically in realtime by OPAL. -->

Currently OPAL server supports two ways to detect changes in the policy git repo:

- **Polling in fixed intervals** - checks every X seconds if new commits are available.
- **Github Webhooks** - if the git repo is stored on github - you may setup a webhook (we plan to expand to generic webhook in the near future).

#### Option 1: Using polling (less recommended)

You may use polling by defining the following env var to a value different than `0`:

| Env Var Name                      | Function                                                   |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL | the interval in seconds to use for polling the policy repo |

#### Option 2: Using a webhook

It is much more recommended to use webhooks if your policy repo is stored in a supported service (currently Github, we are working on expanding this). Webhooks are much more efficient with network traffic, and won't conteminate your logs.

If your server is hosted at `https://opal.yourdomain.com` the webhook URL you must setup with your webhook provider (e.g: github) is `https://opal.yourdomain.com/webhook`. See [GitHub's guide on configuring webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks).

Typically you would need to share a secret with your webhook provider (authenticating incoming webhooks). You can use the OPAL CLI to create a cryptographically strong secret to use.

<a name="generate-secret"></a>Let's install the cli to a new python virtualenv:{" "}

```
pyenv virtualenv opal pyenv activate opal pip install opal-server
```

Now let's use the cli to generate a secret:

```
opal-server generate-secret
```

You must then configure the appropriate env var:

| Env Var Name                    | Function                                                               |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET | the webhook secret generated by the cli (or any other secret you pick) |
