# Step 2: Sending authorization queries to OPA

As mentioned above, the **_OPA Agent_** & it's **REST API** is running on port `:8181`.

Let's explore the current state and send some authorization queries to the agent.

The default policy in the [example repo](https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo) is a simple
[RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) policy, to which we can issue the below request to get the user's
**role assignment and metadata**.

```bash
curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data/users' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' | python -m json.tool
```

The expected response should be like the one below.

```js showLineNumbers
{
    "result": {
        "alice": {
            "location": {
                "country": "US",
                "ip": "8.8.8.8"
            },
            "roles": [
                "admin"
            ]
        },

        ...
    }
}
```

With some user data gathered, let's now issue an **authorization** query. In OPA, an authorization query is a query **with input**.

This below query asks whether the user `bob` can `read` the `finance` resource, where the id of the object is `id123`.

```bash
curl -w '\n' --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data/app/rbac/allow' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"input": {"user": "bob", "action": "read", "object": "id123", "type": "finance"}}'
```

The expected result is `true`, meaning the access is granted.

```bash
{"result": true}
```
