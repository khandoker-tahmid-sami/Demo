# Step 4: Publishing a data update via the OPAL Server

The default policy in the [example repo](https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo) is a **simple RBAC policy with a twist**.

A user is granted access if:

- One of the **roles** has permissions for the requested `action` and `resource type`.
- Only users with the **location** set to `US` can access the resource.

The reason we added the **location** to the policy is to show how **pushing an update** via OPAL with a different
"user location" can **immediately affect access** - demonstrating that realtime updates are needed by most modern applications.

Remember this authorization query we previously run?

```bash
curl -w '\n' --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data/app/rbac/allow' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"input": {"user": "bob", "action": "read", "object": "id123", "type": "finance"}}'
```

Bob is granted access because the initial [`data.json`](https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo/blob/master/data.json#L13) location is `US`.

```json {3,4}
"bob": {
    "roles": ["employee", "billing"],
    "location": {
        "country": "US",
        "ip": "8.8.8.8"
    }
}
```

Therefore, the result of that query is `true`. Now, let's push an update via OPAL and see how poor Bob is denied access.

We can **push an update via the opal-client CLI**. Let's install the CLI to a new python **virtualenv**.

```
pyenv virtualenv opaldemo

pyenv activate opaldemo

pip install opal-client
```

Now, let's use the CLI to **push an update to override the user location**.

```bash
opal-client publish-data-update --src-url https://api.country.is/23.54.6.78 -t policy_data --dst-path /users/bob/location
```

We expect to receive this output from the CLI:

```bash
Publishing event:
entries=[DataSourceEntry(url='https://api.country.is/23.54.6.78', config={}, topics=['policy_data'], dst_path='/users/bob/location', save_method='PUT')] reason=''
Event Published Successfully
```

Now let's issue the same authorization query again.

```bash
curl -w '\n' --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/v1/data/app/rbac/allow' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"input": {"user": "bob", "action": "read", "object": "id123", "type": "finance"}}'
```

And... Bob is denied access.

```bash
{"result": false}
```

So what happened when we published our update with the CLI?

Let's analyze the components of this update. **OPAL data updates** are built to support **your specific use case**.

- You can specify a topic (in our example it was `policy_data`, which) to **target only specific OPAL clients**; and by extension **specific OPA agents**.
  In our example, we used the `policy_data` topic which clients listen to by default (it's also the default topic for updates published with no topics specification).
  Changing this default is only logical if each microservice you have has an OPA sidecar of its own and thus different policy/data needs.

- OPAL specifies **from where** to fetch the data that changed. In this example we used a free and open API ([`api.country.is`](https://api.country.is))
  that anyone can access, however, it can be **your specific API**, or a **3rd-party API**.

- OPAL specifies **to where** in the OPA document hierarchy the data should be saved - by **where**, we mean the **destination path**.
  In this case we override the `/users/bob/location` document with the fetched data.
