# Step 3: Changing and updating the policy in realtime

<!-- Due to the fact the example `docker-compose.yml` makes OPAL track [this repository](https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo)
which regretfully you can not edit yourself, you can follow along this video to see how a git commit can affect the policy in realtime:

```
TBD: video
``` -->

In the `docker-compose.yml` example file that we have mentioned earlier, it is defined that OPAL should
track [this repository](https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo).

Here is a snippet of code from that repo:

```yml {13} showLineNumbers
opal_server:
  # by default we run opal-server from latest official image
  image: permitio/opal-server:latest
  environment:
    # the broadcast backbone uri used by opal server workers (see comments above for: broadcast_channel)
    - OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://postgres:postgres@broadcast_channel:5432/postgres
    # number of uvicorn workers to run inside the opal-server container
    - UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS=4
    # the git repo hosting our policy
    # - if this repo is not public, you can pass an ssh key via `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY`)
    # - the repo we pass in this example is *public* and acts as an example repo with dummy rego policy
    # - for more info, see: https://docs.opal.ac/tutorials/track_a_git_repo
    - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo
    # in this example we will use a polling interval of 30 seconds to check for new policy updates (git commits affecting the rego policy).
    # however, it is better to utilize a git *webhook* to trigger the server to check for changes only when the repo has new commits.
    # for more info see: https://docs.opal.ac/tutorials/track_a_git_repo
    - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL=30
```

You can also simply change the tracked repo in the example `docker-compose.yml` file by editing these variables:

```yml {7,9,11} showLineNumbers
version: "3.8"
services:
  ...
  opal_server:
    environment:
      ...
      - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=<YOUR REPO URL>
      # use this if you want to setup policy updates via git webhook (recommended)
      - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your webhook secret>
      # use this if you want to setup policy updates via polling (not recommended)
      - POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL=<interval in seconds>
```

You can then issue a commit affecting the policy and see that OPA state is indeed changing.
