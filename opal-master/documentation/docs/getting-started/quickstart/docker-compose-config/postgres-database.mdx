# Postgres Database acting as a Broadcast Channel

One of the containers that is handled inside the `docker-compose.yml` config is the broadcast channel.

When **scaling** the OPAL Server to **multiple nodes and/or multiple workers**, we use a broadcast channel to **sync
between all the instances** of the OPAL Server.

```yml showLineNumbers
services:
  broadcast_channel:
    image: postgres:alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```

With this configuration, you can specify **what channel we want to subscribe too**, and in this case, it's a
**PostgreSQL Database**.

:::tip
If you run only a **single worker** it is **not necessary to deploy a broadcast backend**.

**We do not recommend running a single worker in production.**
:::

These are the currently three supported [broadcast backends](https://github.com/encode/broadcaster#available-backends):

1. PostgreSQL
2. Redis
3. Kafka

The format of the broadcaster URI string `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` is specified below for **Postgres**. A similar pattern will apply for
**Redis** and **Kafka**.

```yml
environment:
  - OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://postgres:postgres@broadcast_channel:5432/postgres
```
