# OPAL Server

There are three important concepts in the configuration of the OPAL Server that should be understood.

```yml showLineNumbers
services:
  opal_server:
    image: permitio/opal-server:latest
    environment:
      - OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://postgres:postgres@broadcast_channel:5432/postgres
      - UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS=4
      - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo
      - OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL=30
      - OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES={"config":{"entries":[{"url":"http://opal_server:7002/policy-data","topics":["policy_data"],"dst_path":"/static"}]}}
      - OPAL_LOG_FORMAT_INCLUDE_PID=true
    ports:
      - "7002:7002"
    depends_on:
      - broadcast_channel
```

### 1. Policy-data basic configuration

The OPAL server provides the **base data source configuration** for the OPAL client. The configuration is structured
as **directives** for the client.

Each directive specifies:

1. **what to fetch** - the URL
2. **where to put it in the OPA data document hierarchy** - the destination path

The data sources configured on the server will be fetched **by the client** every time it decides it needs
to fetch the entire data configuration. This could be when the client **first loads**, after a **period of
disconnection** from the server etc.

The data sources specified in the server configuration must always return a complete and up-to-date picture.
In our example `docker-compose.yml` file, the server is configured to return these data sources directives to the client.

Each data source entry has `topics` to help control which clients should process it.
The default topic is `"policy_data"` and is used as a default in both the client (for subscription) and the server (for publishing).
(If publishing to another topic - make sure the client is subscribed to it by setting the `OPAL_DATA_TOPICS` envar)

This is what it looks like:

```yml
OPAL_DATA_CONFIG_SOURCES={"config":{"entries":[{"url":"http://opal_server:7002/policy-data","topics":["policy_data"],"dst_path":"/static"}]}}
```

We fetch the `/policy-data` route on the OPAL server and **assign it to the root data document on OPA** - `i.e: /`.

### 2. Policy-code realtime updates

The **OPAL server tracks a git repository** and feeds the policy code, or more accurately,
`.rego` files along with static data files like `data.json` directly to OPA as a policy.

```yml
OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo
```

If new commits will be pushed to this repository that affect `.rego` or data files, the updated policy will be pushed
to OPA automatically in realtime by OPAL.

The `docker-compose.yml` file declares a **polling interval** to check if new commits are pushed to the repo.

```yml
OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL=30
```

:::tip
When working in a **production environment**, we recommend you setup a **git webhook** from your repo to the OPAL server.

The only reason we are using polling here is because we want the example `docker-compose.yml` file to work for you as well,
and webhooks can only hit a public internet address.

If you are working in a **development environment**, you can use a reverse proxy like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

### 3. Policy-data realtime updates

The **OPAL server can push realtime data updates to the client**. It offers a **REST API** that allows you to push updates
via the server using a pub/sub channel.

Below is an example why realtime updates are important.

:::info EXAMPLE

- Alice just **invited** Bob to a google drive document.
- Bob expects to be able to **view the document immediately**.
- If your authorization layer is implemented with OPA, **you cannot wait for the OPA agent to download a new bundle**,
  it's too slow for live application.
- Instead you **push an update via OPAL** and the state of the OPA agent changes immediately.
