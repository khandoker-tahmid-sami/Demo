# OPAL Client

The OPAL Client has three main functionalities that need to be highlighted.

```yml showLineNumbers
service:
  opal_client:
  image: permitio/opal-client:latest
  environment:
    - OPAL_SERVER_URL=http://opal_server:7002
    - OPAL_LOG_FORMAT_INCLUDE_PID=true
    - OPAL_INLINE_OPA_LOG_FORMAT=http
  ports:
    - "7766:7000"
    - "8181:8181"
  depends_on:
    - opal_server
  command: sh -c "./wait-for.sh opal_server:7002 --timeout=20 -- ./start.sh"
```

### 1. The OPAL client can run OPA for you as an inline process

The OPAL client [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/permitio/opal-client) contains a built-in OPA agent,
and can serve as fully-functional **authorization microservice**. OPA is solely responsible for **enforcing** and
**evaluating authorization queries**.

:::tip FACT
**OPAL** is solely responsible for state-management, meaning it will keep the **policy** and **data** needed to evaluate queries
**up-to-date**.
:::

In our example `docker-compose.yml` file, OPA is enabled and runs on port `:8181` which is exposed on the host machine.

```yml showLineNumbers {3}
ports:
  - "7766:7000"
  - "8181:8181"
```

**OPAL will manage the OPA process**. If the OPA process fails for some reason, OPAL will restart OPA and
rehydrate the OPA cache with valid and up-to-date state. By rehydration, we mean that the policies and data
will be **re-downloaded**.

### 2. The OPAL client syncs OPA with latest policy code

OPAL **listens** to policy code update notifications and **downloads up-to-date policy bundles** from the server.

### 3. The OPAL client syncs OPA with latest policy data

OPAL **listens** to policy data update notifications and **fetches the data from the sources** specified by the instructions
sent from the server. OPAL can aggregate data from multiple sources. This may include your **APIs**, **databases** and **3rd party SaaS**.
