## Simplified (TL;DR)

OPAL consists of two key components that work together:

### OPAL Server

    - Creates a Pub/Sub channel clients subscribe to
    - Tracks a git repository (via webhook / polling) for updates to policy (or static data)
        - Additional versioned repositories can be supported (e.g. S3, SVN)
    - Accepts data update notifications via Rest API
    - pushes updates to clients (as diffs)
    - scales with other server instances via a configurable backbone pub/sub (Currently supported: Postgres, Redis, Kafka; more options will be added in the future)

### OPAL Client

    - Deployed alongside a policy-agent, and keeping it up to date
    - Subscribes to Pub/Sub updates, based on topics for data and policy
    - Downloads data-source configurations from server
        - Fetches data from multiple sources (e.g. DBs, APIs, 3rd party services)
    - Downloads policy from server
    - Keeps policy agents up to date

### Components numbered in the diagram

    1. OPAL-Server
        -  The Server managing data and policy; exposing REST routes for clients to retrieve configurations and Pub/Sub channel for clients to subscribe to updates
    2. OPAL-Client
        - The client, running at edge, adjacent to a policy-agent. Subscribes to data and policy updates. Act's on data-updates to approach data sources and aggregate data from them.
        - Clients open an outgoing websocket connection to servers, thus overcoming most firewall / networking challenges, creating a bi-directional Pub/Sub channel.
    3. Open-Policy-Agent (OPA)
        - The policy engine OPAL augments - by default this is OPA
    4. Application services
        - The application OPAL powers the authorization layer for
    5. Data service
        - A service (or multiple services) as part of the application that connect to the OPAL-server to notify of changes to authorization data (guiding OPAL to aggregate data from the relevant data-sources)
    6. GIT repository
        - A versioned store for the authorization policy
        - Triggers a webhook to the OPAL server to notify of policy changes
        - Can potentially be other version controlled stores (e.g. SVN, Perforce, S3)
    7. Data sources
        - Various services (internal and external) that hold and serve data that needs to be used for authorization decisions (by the policy agents)
        - Examples:
            - App REST API service for user list
            - SQL DB storing user roles
            - Billing SaaS service (e.g. Stripe) to
        - OPAL-Clients can be extended with different FetchProviders to allow extraction of data from various sources.
    8. OPAL admins
        - Developers maintaining the application.
        - Can drive new policies in realtime by simply pushing to their version control (Can simply be the same repository used by CI/CD for the whole app)
        - Can configure and control OPAL clients and their associated policy-agents from a unified control plane
        - Can change the applications data and easily sync authorization to match it.

    9. End users
        - The users of the application, enjoying a seamless experience - working each within their authorization bounds (enforced by open-policy-agents) - e.g. user permissions, roles, tenants.
        - Through OPAL the application's authorization layer adjusts to their needs in realtime - a new user invited can access instantly; new permissions assigned take affect at once. No waiting, no redeployments.
        - Thanks to OPA all requests are processed for authorization in record-breaking speed.

- ## Lightweight Pub/Sub and Backbone Pub/Sub

  ## OPAL's architecture potentially uses two Pub/Sub channels-

        Client <> Server - lightweight websocket Pub/Sub
        Server <> Server - backbone Pub/Sub

        While the lightweight channel requires no additional infrastructure, and can suffice for the can we are running only a single OPAL-server. If we wish to scale-out OPAL-servers, we achieve this using a backbone Pub/Sub (such as Redis, Kafka, or Postgres Listen/Notify) to sync all the servers (So a client connecting to one server, receive notifications of updates that are triggered by another server)
        The backbone Pub/Sub is connected to the lightweight Pub/SUb through the [Broadcaster](https://pypi.org/project/broadcaster/) module.

- ## Communication flows

  The following text describes common data/policy events/scenarios in an OPAL system.

  - User flows:

    - Flows triggered by
    - #### **Authorization queries:**

      - Users -> App -> PolicyAgent
      - Users interact with the application triggering authorization queries that the application resolves with the policy agent (directly). The policy agent is constantly kept up-to date by OPAL so it can answer all the queries correctly.

    - #### **Authorization data changes:**
      - Users -> App data service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
      - Users (e.g. customers, operators, partners, developers) affect the applications authorization layer (e.g. create new users, assign new roles). Application service triggers an event to OPAL-server, which notifies the clients, which collect the needed data from the affected sources.

  - Policy flows

    - #### **Admin updates policy:**

      - Admin -> Git -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients-> Policy Agents
      - The application admin commits a new version of the application policy (or subset thereof), triggering a webhook to the OPAL-server,which analyzes the new version, creates a differential update and notifies the OPAL-clients of it via Pub/Sub. The OPAL-clients connect back to the OPAL server (via REST) to retrieve the update itself.

    - #### **OPAL-server starts :**
      - Git -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
      - A new OPAL-server node starts, spinning out workers - one worker will be elected as the GitPolicySource. The GitPolicySource worker will retrieve the policy from the repository and share it with the other workers (via the FastAPI Pub/Sub channel) and with other server instances (via the backbone pub/sub [e.g. Kafka, Redis, ...]), and through those to all the currently connected clients (via FastAPI Pub/Sub)
    - #### **OPAL-clients starts :**
      - OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
      - The OPAL-client starts and connects to the OPAL-server (via REST) to retrieve it's full policy configuration, caching it directly into the policy-agent.
      - OPAL-clients keep the policy up to date, by subscribing to policy updates (via FastAPI Pub/Sub)

  - Data flows

    - #### **Application updates authorization data:**

      - App Service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents
      - Following an a state changing event (e.g. user interaction, API call) The application changes authorization data, and triggers an update event to the OPAL-server (via REST), including a configured data-topic. The OPAL-server will then propagate (via FastAPI Pub/Sub) the event to all OPAL-clients which subscribed to the data-topic.
        Each client using it's configured data will then approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.

    - #### **A third-party updates authorization data:**

      - Third-party -> App Data Monitoring Service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents
      - A third-party such as a SaaS service updates data relevant for authorization. The Application monitors such changes, and triggers an update event to the OPAL-server (via REST), including a configured data-topic. The OPAL-server will then propagate (via FastAPI Pub/Sub) the event to all OPAL-clients which subscribed to the data-topic.
        Each client using it's configured data will then approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.

    - #### **OPAL-client starts :**
      - OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents
      - OPAL-client connects to OPAL-server (via REST) to download base data-source configuration (for its configured topics); and then using it's configured data will approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.
